<h2>State tab</h2>

This tab provides an editor for <em>grid state</em>.

<ul>
  <li>The state is stored as a plain object</li>
  <li>This object is used to set grid properties <em>declaratively</em></li>
  <li>Hypergrid has API calls for loading and saving state</li>
  <li>Grid properties are generally own members of the <code>grid.properties</code> object (that is, not including its prototype chain, which contains defaults, theming, <i>etc.</i>)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  To make editing easier, this editor, like the Data tabâ€™s editor, uses <code>eval</code> to parse straight JavaScript, not JSON.
  You do not need to concern yourself with strict adherence to the JSON standard (double quotes, primitive types, _etc._).
  And you can also comment out lines, which is not allowed in JSON.
</div>

To set grid properties with the <a class="code" href="https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/Hypergrid.html#setState">grid.setState(state)</a> method is simply a matter of adding members to the root of your <code>state</code> object:

<pre>state = {
    propName: propValue
}</pre>

We will try this on the next page.

<div class="sidebar">
  Click the <span class="button" onclick="this.nextElementSibling.style.backgroundColor='yellow'">&#x25ba;</span> button <em>(above)</em> to go to the next page for the next Activity.
