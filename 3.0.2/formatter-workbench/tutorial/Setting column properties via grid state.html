<h3>Setting column properties declaratively via grid state</h3>

The <code>state</code> object can also be used to set column, row, and cell properties declaratively, as shown below.

<div class="note">
  Setting such properties via <code>grid.setState</code> is only appropriate for static columns, rows, or cells.
  When you donâ€™t know in advance about the columns, you can set column properties programmatically at run-time.
  Row and cell properties can also be set programmatically; they can also be set declaratively in row metadata.
</div>

<p>In addition to properties on the grid proper, properties on individual columns can also be set declaratively in a <code>state</code> object, keyed by column name.</p>

To set properties on a column using a state object, for example the <code>prevclose</code> column:
<pre>{
    columns: {
        prevclose: {
            propName: 'value'
        }
    }
}</pre>

You can see this construct being used in the <span class="tab">State</span> tab for the <code>halign</code> (horizontal alignment) property, to right-justify the numbers in the column. We will try this in <span class="activity">Activity 5</span>, a few pages hence.

<div class="note">
  <code>state.columns</code> (like <code>state.rows</code> and <code>state.cells</code>, discussed below)
  is a <em>dynamic property</em> (or <em>pseudo-property</em>).
  It is not actually a grid property; there is no such thing as <code style="text-decoration:line-through">grid.properties.columns</code>.
  Dynamic properties are implemented as accessors.
  In this case, <code>state.columns</code> is a write-only implementation (just a setter)
  that sets properties in individual column's <code>properties</code> objects rather than in <code>grid.properties</code>.
</div>

Setting column properties can also be accomplished programmatically with API calls.
