<h3 class="continued">Validation</h3>

The following shows how the two-stage approach can often be the simplest:

<pre>function invalid(s) {
  return !/^\d+°$/.test(s); // note no capture group needed here
}
function parse(s) {
  return parseInt(s);
}</pre>

You can combine the two stages into parse, but this will get messier as the complexity of the syntax being parsed grows:

<pre>function parse(s) {
  if (!/^\d+°$/.test(s)) throw new SyntaxError;
  return parseInt(s);
}</pre>

Without regular expressions, you can implement your own FSM or take a brute force approach, such as the following.

<pre>function invalid(s) {
  var j = s.length - 1;
  if (s[j] !== '°') {
    return false;
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < j ; ++i) {
    if ('0' > i || i > '9') {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}</pre>

As you can see, this is a lot of code that needs to be debugged and tested. On a practical level, this is a very simple syntax. For anything more complicated, this kind of brute force approach would quickly get out of hand. It's also very difficult to expand.
