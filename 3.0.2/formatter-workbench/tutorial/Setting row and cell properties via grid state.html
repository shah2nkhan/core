<h3>Setting row and cell properties declaratively via grid state</h3>

<p>
  We can also set row and cell proertiess through grid state, as shown for column properties on the previous page.
  In these cases, you also need to specify the subgrid (usually <code>data</code>), as row numbers and cell coordinates are local to subgrids.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <code>state.rows</code> and <code>state.cells</code> (like <code>state.columns</code>, discussed on the previous page)
  are a <em>dynamic properties</em> (or <em>pseudo-properties</em>).
  They are not actually a grid properties; there is are such things as
  <code style="text-decoration:line-through">grid.properties.rows</code>
  and <code style="text-decoration:line-through">grid.properties.cells</code>.
  Dynamic properties are implemented as accessors.
  In these cases, <code>state.rows</code> and <code>state.cells</code> have write-only implementations (just setters)
  that set properties on individual rowss and cells rather than in <code>grid.properties</code>.
</div>

To set properties on a data row using a state object, for example on the fourth data row (row index 3):
<pre>{
    rows: {
        data: {
            3: {
                propName: 'value'
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

To set properties on a data cell using a state object, for example the cell at the intersection of the fourth data row and the <code>prevclose</code> column:

<pre>{
    cells: {
        data: {
            3: {
                prevclose: {
                    propName: 'value'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

It is worth repeating that both of the above constructs are only useful in static grids, when you know the row numbers in advance.
Otherwise, consider programmatic API calls or row metadata to set row and cell properties.
